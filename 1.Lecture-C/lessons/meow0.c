// Opportunity for better design

// Description: This C program prints the word "meow" to the console three times. While the code is functional, there is an opportunity for better design to make it more efficient and concise.

// Include necessary library: stdio.h for printf.
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    // Print "meow" three times using separate printf statements.
    printf("meow\n");
    printf("meow\n");
    printf("meow\n");
}

// Explanation:

// The comments at the top provide a brief description of the program's purpose, which is to print the word "meow" to the console three times. It also points out that while the code is functional, there is an opportunity for better design.

// The #include <stdio.h> line includes the necessary library for using the printf function.

// Inside the main function, the program uses three separate printf statements to print the word "meow" followed by a newline character ("\n") three times.

// While this code works as intended, there is an opportunity for better design. Instead of using multiple printf statements, a more efficient approach would be to use a loop to print "meow" the desired number of times. This would make the code more concise and maintainable.

// The current code repetition might not be practical if you needed to print "meow" a larger number of times, as it would involve duplicating the printf statements. A loop would allow you to specify the number of times you want to repeat "meow" without duplicating code.

// Overall, while the code is functional, it could be improved for efficiency and flexibility.
