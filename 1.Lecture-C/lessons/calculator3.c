// Division with longs, demonstrating truncation

// Description: This C program prompts the user to enter two long integers, divides 'x' by 'y', and assigns the result to a float variable 'z'. It then prints 'z' as a floating-point number, demonstrating truncation when dividing long integers.

// Include necessary libraries: cs50.h for get_long and stdio.h for printf.
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    // Prompt the user to enter the first long integer and store it in the variable 'x'.
    long x = get_long("x: ");

    // Prompt the user to enter the second long integer and store it in the variable 'y'.
    long y = get_long("y: ");

    // Divide 'x' by 'y' and store the result in the float variable 'z'.
    float z = x / y;

    // Print 'z' as a floating-point number.
    printf("%f\n", z);
}

// Explanation:

// The comments at the top provide a brief description of the program's purpose, which is to prompt the user to enter two long integers, divide 'x' by 'y', assign the result to a float variable 'z', and then print 'z' as a floating-point number. It also mentions that the code demonstrates truncation when dividing long integers.

// The #include <cs50.h> and #include <stdio.h> lines include the necessary libraries for using get_long and printf functions.

// Inside the main function, the long x = get_long("x: "); line prompts the user to enter the first long integer and stores it in the variable 'x'.

// The long y = get_long("y: "); line prompts the user to enter the second long integer and stores it in the variable 'y'.

// The program divides 'x' by 'y' using the division operator '/', and the result is assigned to the float variable 'z'.

// The program then prints 'z' as a floating-point number using printf with the "%f" placeholder.

// It's important to note that even though the result is stored in a float variable, truncation still occurs because the division was done with long integers.

// This code serves as an example of division with long integers in C and how truncation can affect the result when assigning it to a float variable.
