// get_string and printf with incorrect placeholder

// Description: This C program attempts to get the user's name and print a greeting but contains an error in the printf statement where "answer" should be a variable, not a string.

// Include necessary libraries: cs50.h for get_string and stdio.h for printf.
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    // Get the user's name as a string and store it in the "answer" variable.
    string answer = get_string("What's your name? ");

    // Attempt to print a greeting, but there's an error in the printf statement.
    printf("hello, answer\n");
}

// Explanation:

// The comments at the top provide a brief description of the program's purpose, which is to get the user's name and print a greeting. It also points out the presence of an error in the printf statement.

// The #include <cs50.h> and #include <stdio.h> lines include the necessary libraries for using the get_string and printf functions.

// Inside the main function, the string answer = get_string("What's your name? "); line uses the get_string function to collect the user's name as a string and stores it in the "answer" variable.

// The printf("hello, answer\n"); line is intended to print a greeting, but there's an error in the printf statement where "answer" should be a variable containing the user's name, not the string "answer."

// This code demonstrates an error in using printf with an incorrect placeholder, as it should display the user's name correctly.
