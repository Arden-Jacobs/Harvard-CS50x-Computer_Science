// get_string and printf with %s

// Description: This C program collects the user's name as a string and prints a greeting using the correct placeholder "%s" for the name.

// Include necessary libraries: cs50.h for get_string and stdio.h for printf.
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    // Get the user's name as a string and store it in the "answer" variable.
    string answer = get_string("What's your name? ");

    // Use printf with the correct placeholder "%s" to display a greeting along with the user's name.
    printf("hello, %s\n", answer);
}

// Explanation:

// The comments at the top provide a brief description of the program's purpose, which is to collect the user's name as a string and correctly print a greeting using the placeholder "%s" for the name.

// The #include <cs50.h> and #include <stdio.h> lines include the necessary libraries for using the get_string and printf functions.

// Inside the main function, the string answer = get_string("What's your name? "); line collects the user's name as a string and stores it in the "answer" variable.

// The printf("hello, %s\n", answer); line is used to print a greeting, and it correctly uses the placeholder "%s" to insert the user's name in the output.

// This code demonstrates the proper usage of the printf function in C to display text along with variable values.
