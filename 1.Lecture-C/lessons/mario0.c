// Prints a row of 4 question marks

// Description: This C program prints a row of 4 question marks to the console.

// Include the necessary library: stdio.h for printf.
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    // Print a row of 4 question marks followed by a newline character.
    printf("????\n");
}

// Explanation:

// The comments at the top provide a brief description of the program's purpose, which is to print a row of 4 question marks to the console.

// The #include <stdio.h> line includes the necessary library for using the printf function.

// Inside the main function, the program uses the printf function to print the string "????" (a row of 4 question marks) to the console.

// The "\n" in the string adds a newline character to move to the next line, ensuring that the row of question marks is followed by a line break.

// This code serves as a simple example of using printf to display text on the console.
