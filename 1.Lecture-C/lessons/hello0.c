/* Explanation:

The comments at the top provide a brief description of the program's purpose, which is to say "hello" to the world.

The #include <stdio.h> line includes the standard I/O library, which is necessary for using the printf function.

The int main(void) function is the entry point of the program, where execution begins.

Inside the main function, the printf("hello, world\n"); line uses the printf function to display the message "hello, world" on the console.
