// Logical operators

// Description: This C program asks the user if they agree by entering 'Y' or 'N'. It uses logical operators to check whether the user agreed or not and prints the corresponding message.

// Include necessary libraries: cs50.h for get_char and stdio.h for printf.
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    // Prompt the user to agree by entering 'Y' or 'N' and store the response in the variable 'c'.
    char c = get_char("Do you agree? ");

    // Check whether the user agreed (entered 'Y' or 'y').
    if (c == 'Y' || c == 'y')
    {
        printf("Agreed.\n");
    }
    // Check whether the user did not agree (entered 'N' or 'n').
    else if (c == 'N' || c == 'n')
    {
        printf("Not agreed.\n");
    }
}

// Explanation:

// The comments at the top provide a brief description of the program's purpose, which is to ask the user if they agree by entering 'Y' or 'N'. It then uses logical operators to determine whether the user agreed and prints the appropriate message.

// The #include <cs50.h> and #include <stdio.h> lines include the necessary libraries for using get_char and printf functions.

// Inside the main function, the char c = get_char("Do you agree? "); line prompts the user to agree by entering 'Y' or 'N' and stores their response in the variable 'c'.

// The program uses logical operators to check whether the user agreed. If the user entered 'Y' or 'y', it prints "Agreed." If the user entered 'N' or 'n', it prints "Not agreed."

// This code demonstrates the use of logical operators to make decisions based on user input.
