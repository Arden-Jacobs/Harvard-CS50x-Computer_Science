// Include necessary library for the program
#include <stdio.h>

// Main function, entry point of the program
int main(void)
{
    // Iterate from 0 to 3 (inclusive)
    for (int i = 0; i <= 3; i++)
    {
        // Print a pound sign followed by a newline character
        printf("#\n");
    }
}

- Note: This code doesn't contain any apparent bugs, but it's worth mentioning that the loop condition (i <= 3) will execute the loop four times (for i equal to 0, 1, 2, and 3). 
   - If you intended to execute the loop three times, you might want to change the condition to i < 3.
