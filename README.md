# Harvard University’s CS50x

This is CS50, Harvard University’s introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming, for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience. (Two thirds of CS50 students have never taken CS before.) This course teaches you how to solve problems, both with and without code, with an emphasis on correctness, design, and style. Topics include computational thinking, abstraction, algorithms, data structures, and computer science more generally. Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. More than teach you how to program in one language, this course teaches you how to program fundamentally and how to teach yourself new languages ultimately. The course starts with a traditional but omnipresent language called C that underlies today’s newer languages, via which you’ll learn not only about functions, variables, conditionals, loops, and more, but also about how computers themselves work underneath the hood, memory and all. The course then transitions to Python, a higher-level language that you’ll understand all the more because of C. Toward term’s end, the course introduces SQL, via which you can store data in databases, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, via which you can create web and mobile apps alike. Course culminates in a final project.

## Introduction to Computer Science

Welcome to the "Introduction to Computer Science" repository! This course teaches you how to solve problems, both with and without code, with an emphasis on correctness, design, and style.
Topics include computational thinking, abstraction, algorithms, data structures, and computer science more generally. Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences.
More than teach you how to program in one language, this course teaches you how to program fundamentally and how to teach yourself new languages ultimately.

## Course Overview

This repository contains resources and materials for learning Computer Science. The course covers a wide range of topics:

The course starts with a traditional but omnipresent language called C that underlies today’s newer languages, via which you’ll learn not only about functions, variables, conditionals, loops, and more, but also about how computers themselves work underneath the hood, memory and all.
The course then transitions to Python, a higher-level language that you’ll understand all the more because of C. Toward term’s end, the course introduces SQL, via which you can store data in databases, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, via which you can create web and mobile apps alike. Course culminates in a final project..

## Learning Approach

The course adopts a hands-on learning approach to provide you with practical experience. Real-world programming problems inspire the exercises, enabling you to apply the concepts you've learned in a meaningful context.

## Getting Started

To begin, you can either use your own PC or Mac for coding or utilize a web browser. No specific software installation is required. Simply clone this repository and start exploring the provided resources.

## Repository Structure

- `/lessons`: Contains code examples discussed during the course.
- `/problem_set`: Includes exercises inspired by real-world programming problems.
- `/project`: Advanced projects to further practice and showcase skills (final project).

## Acknowledgments

I extend my gratitude to CS50 for the resources that have made this journey possible. All content is to showcase my CS50 journey and my own ref for learning purpose.
